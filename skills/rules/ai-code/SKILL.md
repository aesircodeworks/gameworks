# AI Code Rules

- AI update budget: 2ms per frame maximum — profile to verify
- All AI parameters must be tunable from data files (behavior tree weights, perception ranges, timers)
- AI must be debuggable: implement visualization hooks for all AI state (paths, perception cones, decision trees)
- AI should telegraph intentions — players need time to read and react
- Prefer utility-based or behavior tree approaches over hard-coded if/else chains
- Group AI must support formation, flanking, and role assignment from data
- All AI state machines must log transitions for debugging
- Never trust AI input from the network without validation

## Scope

These rules apply to a target game workspace, not the Aesir profile repository.

## Target file patterns

- `src/ai/**`

These rules apply to a target game workspace, not the Aesir profile repository.
