# Engine Code Rules

- ZERO allocations in hot paths (update loops, rendering, physics) — pre-allocate, pool, reuse
- All engine APIs must be thread-safe OR explicitly documented as single-thread-only
- Profile before AND after every optimization — document the measured numbers
- Engine code must NEVER depend on gameplay code (strict dependency direction: engine <- gameplay)
- Every public API must have usage examples in its doc comment
- Changes to public interfaces require a deprecation period and migration guide
- Use RAII / deterministic cleanup for all resources
- All engine systems must support graceful degradation
- Before writing engine API code, consult `docs/engine-reference/` for the current engine version and verify APIs against the reference docs

## Examples

**Correct** (zero-alloc hot path):

```gdscript
# Pre-allocated array reused each frame
var _nearby_cache: Array[Node3D] = []

func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
    _nearby_cache.clear()  # Reuse, don't reallocate
    _spatial_grid.query_radius(position, radius, _nearby_cache)
```

**Incorrect** (allocating in hot path):

```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
    var nearby: Array[Node3D] = []  # VIOLATION: allocates every frame
    nearby = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("enemies")  # VIOLATION: tree query every frame
```

## Scope

These rules apply to a target game workspace, not the Aesir profile repository.

## Target file patterns

- `src/core/**`

These rules apply to a target game workspace, not the Aesir profile repository.
